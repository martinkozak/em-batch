EventMachine Batch
==================

**em-batch** provides ability to run more callbacked methods 
of single or more objects by elegant, readable and transparent way 
in a linear sequence, so subsequently in single batch.

Two classes are available, *sequencer* and more general *batch*.
Batch supports more objects in one batch, sequencer is syntactic
sugar in fact for single object.

It's implementation of the [callback-batch][9] gem, but customized
for running in [EventMachine][8] environment, so calls will be fully
multiplexed to more subsequent ticks.
  
See some trivial examples:

    require "eventmachine"
    require "callback-batch"
    
    class Foo
        def foo1
            yield :foo1
        end
        def foo2
            yield :foo2
        end
    end
    
    class Bar
        def bar1
            yield :bar1
        end
        def bar2
            yield :bar2
        end    
    end
    
    
    EM::run do

        ### Sequencer
        
        s = CallbackSequencer::new(Foo::new)
        s.foo1
        s.foo2
        
        s.execute do      # now will be both methods executed
            p s.results   # will contain [:foo1, :foo2]
        end
    
        ### Batch
    
        s = CallbackBatch::new
        f = Foo::new
        b = Bar::new
        
        s.take(f).foo1
        s.take(b).bar2
        
        s.execute do      # now will be both methods executed
            p s.results   # will contain [:foo1, :bar2]
        end
        
    end
